### Things I Feel Like Mentioning 4 Now

I like most things devtool oriented. I have some public contribs to the following:

- https://github.com/cdr/code-server
- https://github.com/cdr/coder-cli
- https://github.com/cdr/enterprise-images
- https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint

I like mathematics, but am a complete amateur

- Wrote [this](https://github.com/vapurrmaid/markov-chain) and have been meaning to write some kind of example project consuming its powers.

Whenever I find time again, I'll be studying more on generative (art/text/images)

- Made a goth name thingy [here](https://github.com/vapurrmaid/Gotherator) but the algo needs new powers when I find time
